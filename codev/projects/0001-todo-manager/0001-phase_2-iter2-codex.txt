Phase 2 implementation is aligned with the plan and prior write-path concern appears resolved.

- Spec/plan adherence:
  - `src/types/todo.ts` defines required Todo shape and filter types.
  - `src/types/actions.ts` defines all required NL action unions (`ADD_TODO`, `UPDATE_TODO`, `DELETE_TODO`, `LIST_TODOS`, `CLARIFY`, `RESPONSE`).
  - `src/lib/storage.ts` implements CRUD, filtering, default values, max-length validation, and createdAt-desc sorting helper.
  - `src/hooks/useTodos.ts` wraps storage ops with React state and filtering.
- Error handling:
  - Write-path failures are now handled: `saveTodos` throws a wrapped error on `localStorage.setItem` failure.
  - Read-path failures are handled gracefully (`getTodos` returns `[]` on parse/storage errors).
- Tests:
  - `src/__tests__/storage.test.ts` includes coverage for CRUD, filtering, sorting, validations, defaults, and localStorage failure paths (including save and add write failures).
  - Test suite passes: 39/39 tests.
