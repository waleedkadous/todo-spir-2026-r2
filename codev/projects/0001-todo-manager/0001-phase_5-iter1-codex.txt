1. `HIGH` `package.json:8`  
`phase_5` acceptance requires `npm run build` to succeed, but the current build script (`next build`) fails in this environment with a Turbopack internal error (`Failed to write app endpoint /page`, port-binding failure).  
Evidence:
- `npm test` passed (`99/99`)
- `npm run build` failed
- `npx next build --webpack` succeeded, indicating the issue is tied to the configured build path, not the app code itself.

Open questions / assumptions:
- I could not fully verify `npm start` due sandbox runtime restrictions (process/port limitations), so production start behavior remains unconfirmed in this environment.
- `.env.example` is present and complete for this phase (`.env.example:1`).
- Railway readiness is partially present (`next.config.ts:4` uses `output: "standalone"`), but the build-script failure blocks phase acceptance.

VERDICT: REQUEST_CHANGES
SUMMARY: Phase 5 is close, but fails its own acceptance because `npm run build` does not pass as currently scripted.
CONFIDENCE: HIGH
---

KEY_ISSUES: `npm run build` fails with current script (`package.json:8`), violating phase_5 acceptance criteria.
