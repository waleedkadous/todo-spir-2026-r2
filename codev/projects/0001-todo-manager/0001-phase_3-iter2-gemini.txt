The implementation of Phase 3 is complete and adheres to the plan and specification. The builder has correctly implemented the required UI components (TodoList, TodoForm, FilterBar, EmptyState) and the responsive layout (mobile stack, desktop sidebar).

Regarding the previous dispute about testing: The plan for Phase 3 explicitly specifies **"Manual Testing"** only. Automated unit tests were delivered in Phase 2, and integration tests are scheduled for Phase 4. Therefore, the absence of automated UI tests in this phase is consistent with the approved plan.

The code is modular, uses appropriate React hooks, and handles edge cases like validation and empty states. The responsive layout is implemented using standard Tailwind classes (`flex-col lg:flex-row`), matching the "desktop sidebar + mobile stack" requirement.
