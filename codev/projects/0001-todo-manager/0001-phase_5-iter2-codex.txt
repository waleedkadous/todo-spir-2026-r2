Findings (Phase 5 scope only): no critical implementation issues found.

What I verified against Phase 5:
- `npm test` passes fully: 99/99 tests (`src/__tests__/setup.test.ts`, `src/__tests__/storage.test.ts`, `src/__tests__/actionExecutor.test.ts`, `src/__tests__/api-chat.test.ts`).
- Railway/deployment config is present via standalone output: `next.config.ts:4` sets `output: "standalone"`.
- Build/start scripts are correctly defined in `package.json:7-12` (`build`, `start`, `test`).
- `.env.example` includes required key: `.env.example:2` has `GEMINI_API_KEY=...`.
- Runtime env handling is implemented: `src/lib/gemini.ts:5` throws if `GEMINI_API_KEY` is missing; API route handles that safely (`src/app/api/chat/route.ts:93`).

On the prior disputed build concern:
- In this sandbox, `npm run build` fails with Turbopack EPERM port-binding (environment restriction), same as previously reported.
- `npx next build --webpack` succeeds in this repo, indicating app/build correctness independent of that sandbox-specific Turbopack failure.

Residual risk:
- I could not truly validate `npm start` runtime in this sandbox because all local port binding is blocked (`listen EPERM`), so that acceptance item is environment-blocked here rather than code-blocked.

VERDICT: APPROVE
SUMMARY: Phase 5 deliverables are implemented and aligned with plan; test suite is fully green and deployment/env configuration is complete, with build/start sandbox limitations accounted for.
CONFIDENCE: HIGH
