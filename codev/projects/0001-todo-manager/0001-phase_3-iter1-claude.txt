I'll start by reading the spec and plan files, then explore the implementation.Now let me explore the implementation files for Phase 3. Let me find all the component files and the main page.Good, all expected component files exist. Let me read them all, along with the supporting files from previous phases.Now let me check the Phase 2 deliverables that Phase 3 depends on — the types and hooks:Now let me verify the build compiles and check if there's anything else relevant:TypeScript compiles cleanly. Let me now do a thorough review against the Phase 3 acceptance criteria by checking a few more details:Build succeeds. Now let me compile my review.

## Phase 3 Review: Todo UI Components

### Deliverables Checklist (Plan Phase 3)

| Deliverable | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `TodoList.tsx` — list view with filtering | ✅ | Renders list, delegates to TodoItem, shows EmptyState |
| `TodoItem.tsx` — single todo with actions | ✅ | Edit, delete, toggle status all implemented |
| `TodoForm.tsx` — create/edit form with validation | ✅ | Title required, max 200, desc max 2000, priority, due date |
| `FilterBar.tsx` — status and priority filters | ✅ | Both dropdowns with all/specific values |
| `EmptyState.tsx` — shown when no todos | ✅ | Distinguishes "no todos" vs "no matching filters" |
| `src/app/page.tsx` — main page composing all | ✅ | Composes all components with useTodos hook |

### Acceptance Criteria Assessment

| Criterion | Met? | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Can create a todo with all fields | ✅ | TodoForm covers title, description, priority, dueDate |
| Form validation enforces field constraints | ✅ | Title required + max 200 chars; description max 2000 chars; `maxLength` HTML attrs + JS validation |
| Can edit any todo field inline | ✅ | Edit button renders TodoForm with initialData |
| Can delete a todo | ✅ | Delete with confirmation (Confirm/Cancel buttons) |
| Can toggle todo status (pending/completed) | ✅ | Checkbox-style toggle with visual feedback |
| Filters work for status and priority | ✅ | FilterBar + useTodos filtering chain |
| Empty state shown when appropriate | ✅ | Two variants: no todos, no filter matches |
| Responsive on mobile | ✅ | Uses `flex-wrap`, `min-w-[120px]`, responsive max-width container |

### Code Quality Assessment

**Strengths:**
1. **Clean component decomposition** — Each component has a clear, single responsibility. Props interfaces are well-typed.
2. **Consistent patterns** — All components use `"use client"`, consistent Tailwind styling approach, proper event handling.
3. **Good accessibility** — `aria-label` on icon-only buttons (toggle status, edit, delete), `htmlFor` on all labels, semantic form elements.
4. **Proper form handling** — Validation happens both via HTML `maxLength` attribute AND JavaScript validation in `handleSubmit`, providing defense in depth. Form resets after successful creation. Error state is clearly displayed.
5. **Delete confirmation** — Inline confirm/cancel pattern prevents accidental deletes.
6. **Visual polish** — Priority color coding, completed todo styling (line-through, muted colors), transition effects.
7. **TypeScript is strict** — No `any` types, proper use of Pick/Partial for update types.

**Minor Observations (non-blocking):**
1. **Due date display** (TodoItem:124) uses `new Date(todo.dueDate + "T00:00:00")` to avoid timezone-shifted date display — this is a thoughtful and correct approach for date-only values.
2. **Character counter** on title and description fields is a nice UX touch that the spec didn't require but enhances usability.
3. The layout uses `max-w-3xl` with `pb-24` padding at the bottom — the `pb-24` appears to be reserving space for the chat panel that will be added in Phase 4. That's forward-thinking without prematurely implementing Phase 4 work.

### Potential Issues (Minor — COMMENT level, not blocking)

1. **No overdue date styling**: Todos with past due dates don't get any visual warning. This isn't in the spec, so it's not required, but it would be a good UX enhancement.

2. **Edit form re-renders**: When editing, the entire TodoItem is replaced with a TodoForm. The form's `autoFocus` on the title input is fine, but users lose scroll context if the form is a different height. This is standard behavior and not a bug.

3. **No todo count display**: There's no indicator of how many todos match the current filter. Minor UX item, not in spec.

### Build Verification

- ✅ TypeScript compiles with zero errors (`npx tsc --noEmit`)
- ✅ Production build succeeds (`npm run build`)
- ✅ All component files present at expected paths

### Test Coverage

The plan specifies **Manual Testing** for Phase 3, not automated tests. This is acceptable — the component tests would require significant test infrastructure (render, user events, mock hooks) and the plan correctly defers this to testing as part of the overall verification in Phase 5. The Phase 2 unit tests for the underlying storage/CRUD logic cover the data layer.

---

**Overall Assessment**: This is a clean, well-structured Phase 3 implementation. All six expected component files are present and well-implemented. The components compose correctly through the page, types are properly shared from Phase 2, and the build passes cleanly. Form validation enforces the spec's field constraints at both the HTML and JavaScript layers. The UI handles all CRUD operations, filtering, empty states, and responsive layout as specified. Code quality is high with good accessibility practices.

VERDICT: APPROVE
SUMMARY: All Phase 3 deliverables complete — clean CRUD UI with filtering, validation, empty states, and delete confirmation; builds successfully.
CONFIDENCE: HIGH
