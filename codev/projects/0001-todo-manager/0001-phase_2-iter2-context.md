### Iteration 1 Reviews
- gemini: APPROVE — Todo data layer, types, and hooks are correctly implemented and tested.
- codex: REQUEST_CHANGES — Phase 2 is mostly complete, but write-path localStorage failure handling (and tests for it) is missing against phase requirements.
- claude: APPROVE — Phase 2 delivers all planned files with correct types, validated CRUD operations, React hook, and 35 passing unit tests — fully aligned with spec and plan.

### IMPORTANT: Stateful Review Context
This is NOT the first review iteration. Previous reviewers raised concerns and the builder has responded.
Before re-raising a previous concern:
1. Check if the builder has already addressed it in code
2. If the builder disputes a concern with evidence, verify the claim against actual project files before insisting
3. Do not re-raise concerns that have been explained as false positives with valid justification
4. Check package.json and config files for version numbers before flagging missing configuration
