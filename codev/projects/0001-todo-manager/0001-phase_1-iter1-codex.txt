1. **Plan alignment gap (phase_1 deliverable missing)**  
`tailwind.config.ts` is not present in the repo, even though Phase 1 explicitly lists it as a file to create/modify (`codev/plans/0001-todo-manager.md`). Tailwind may still work with v4 defaults via `@import "tailwindcss";` in `src/app/globals.css`, but this does not match the committed phase plan deliverables.

2. **Acceptance criteria not demonstrated for build/dev in this environment**  
`npm test` passes (`src/__tests__/setup.test.ts`), but `npm run build` fails in this sandbox with a Turbopack process/port permission error unrelated to app logic. So Phase 1 criterion “`npm run build` succeeds” is not verified from this run.

Open questions/assumptions:
1. If the team intentionally chose Tailwind v4 zero-config, should Phase 1 plan be updated to remove mandatory `tailwind.config.ts` rather than requiring the file?
2. Build failure appears environment-restricted; this should be rechecked in a normal local/CI environment.

VERDICT: REQUEST_CHANGES  
SUMMARY: Phase 1 scaffold is mostly correct, but it does not fully align with the plan because `tailwind.config.ts` is missing.  
CONFIDENCE: HIGH

KEY_ISSUES: Missing `tailwind.config.ts` deliverable required by Phase 1 plan (`codev/plans/0001-todo-manager.md`)
