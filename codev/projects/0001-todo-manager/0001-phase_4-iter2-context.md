### Iteration 1 Reviews
- gemini: REQUEST_CHANGES — [One-line summary of your review]
- codex: REQUEST_CHANGES — Core phase-4 pieces exist and tests pass, but there are functional gaps in graceful Gemini-unavailable handling, robust 100KB enforcement, and execution of date-based LIST filters.
- claude: APPROVE — Phase 4 delivers a complete, well-tested NL chat interface with solid error handling and clean architecture

### IMPORTANT: Stateful Review Context
This is NOT the first review iteration. Previous reviewers raised concerns and the builder has responded.
Before re-raising a previous concern:
1. Check if the builder has already addressed it in code
2. If the builder disputes a concern with evidence, verify the claim against actual project files before insisting
3. Do not re-raise concerns that have been explained as false positives with valid justification
4. Check package.json and config files for version numbers before flagging missing configuration
