  ## Summary
  Implements a complete Todo Manager with a natural language interface powered by Gemini 2.0 Flash. Features a responsive CRUD UI with localStorage persistence and server-side API proxying for secure NL processing.

  ## Key Changes
  - **Core Logic**: `src/lib/storage.ts` implements robust CRUD with validation and safe JSON parsing.
  - **NL Interface**: `src/lib/actionExecutor.ts` and `src/app/api/chat/route.ts` handle natural language command parsing and execution with strict schema validation.
  - **UI**: Responsive two-column layout using Tailwind CSS v4 and Next.js 16 App Router.
  - **Testing**: Added 101 unit and integration tests covering storage, action execution, and API routes.

  ## Test Plan
  - Run `npm test` to verify all 101 unit/integration tests pass.
  - Run `npm run lint` to ensure code style compliance.
  - Manual verification: Open the app, create todos, and use the chat interface to "add a high priority todo to buy milk" or "show completed todos".
