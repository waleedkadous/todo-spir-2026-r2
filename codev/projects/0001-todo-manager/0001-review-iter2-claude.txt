PR review iteration 2 for [Spec 0001] Todo Manager.

Changes since iteration 1:
- Fixed corrupted localStorage handling: `getTodos()` now validates that parsed JSON is an array via `Array.isArray(parsed)`, returning `[]` for non-array data. Two new tests added for object and string shapes.
- Rebuttals provided for empty UPDATE_TODO updates (by-design, Gemini-controlled input) and date format validation (handled by system prompt, not action executor).

The fix is correct and minimal. The rebuttals are well-reasoned.

Overall assessment: 101 tests passing, clean build, clean lint. All spec criteria met. Code quality is strong throughout. The localStorage shape validation fix addresses the only legitimate concern from iteration 1.
