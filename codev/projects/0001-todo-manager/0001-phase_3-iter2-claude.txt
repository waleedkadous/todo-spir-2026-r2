I'll start by reading the spec, plan, and then exploring the implementation files.Now let me explore the implementation files for Phase 3.Good — all Phase 3 component files exist. Now let me read all of them plus the main page.Now let me also check the supporting files from Phase 2 that Phase 3 depends on — specifically the types and hook:Now let me verify the build succeeds to confirm everything compiles correctly:Build succeeds. Now I have a complete picture of the Phase 3 implementation. Let me compile my review.

## Phase 3 Review: Todo UI Components

### 1. Spec Adherence

I've verified each Phase 3 deliverable against the plan:

| Deliverable | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Todo list component with filtering | ✅ | `TodoList.tsx` renders filtered list, delegates to `EmptyState` when empty |
| Todo creation form with validation | ✅ | `TodoForm.tsx` validates title required, max 200 chars, description max 2000 chars |
| Todo edit inline or modal | ✅ | `TodoItem.tsx` switches to inline `TodoForm` with `initialData` and "Save Changes" label |
| Delete confirmation | ✅ | `TodoItem.tsx` shows Confirm/Cancel buttons on delete click |
| Filter controls (status + priority) | ✅ | `FilterBar.tsx` with status and priority dropdowns |
| Empty state display | ✅ | `EmptyState.tsx` distinguishes between "no todos" and "no matching todos" |
| Responsive layout (desktop sidebar + mobile stack) | ✅ | `page.tsx` uses `flex-col lg:flex-row` with aside placeholder for Phase 4 chat |
| Main page composing all components | ✅ | `page.tsx` wires up `useTodos`, `FilterBar`, `TodoForm`, `TodoList` |

All Phase 3 acceptance criteria are satisfied.

### 2. Code Quality

**Strengths:**
- Clean component decomposition — each component has a single responsibility
- Well-typed props with TypeScript interfaces throughout
- Consistent Tailwind styling patterns
- Proper use of `"use client"` directives
- Good accessibility: `aria-label` on toggle/edit/delete buttons, `htmlFor` on all labels
- Character counters on title/description fields provide good UX feedback
- `handleEdit` correctly maps form data shape to `onUpdate` shape, including clearing optional fields

**Minor observations (non-blocking):**
- `TodoForm` resets fields after create (`!initialData` check on line 59) — good pattern for UX
- The `dueDate` display on line 124 (`todo.dueDate + "T00:00:00"`) is a reasonable approach to avoid timezone-shift issues with date-only strings — pragmatic solution

### 3. Test Coverage

The Phase 3 plan explicitly specifies **Manual Testing only**:

> **Test Plan**  
> - **Manual Testing**: Full CRUD workflow, filter combinations, mobile viewport, validation errors

The builder's response from Iteration 1 correctly explains this: Phase 3 components are thin UI wrappers over the already-tested storage layer (39 unit tests in Phase 2). Automated UI tests are not a Phase 3 deliverable. The plan reserves automated testing for phases that introduce testable logic (Phase 2 done, Phase 4 planned). I've verified this against the plan file and concur — no issue here.

### 4. Error Handling

- Form validation handles empty title, title > 200 chars, description > 2000 chars ✅
- HTML `maxLength` attributes provide browser-level prevention as a first line of defense ✅
- `try/catch` around `onSubmit` in TodoForm catches storage errors gracefully ✅
- Empty state distinguishes filtered-empty vs truly-empty todo list ✅

### 5. Plan Alignment

All files listed in the Phase 3 implementation details are present:
- `src/components/TodoList.tsx` ✅
- `src/components/TodoItem.tsx` ✅
- `src/components/TodoForm.tsx` ✅
- `src/components/FilterBar.tsx` ✅
- `src/components/EmptyState.tsx` ✅
- `src/app/page.tsx` (updated from placeholder) ✅

The `page.tsx` layout includes a placeholder `<aside>` for the Phase 4 chat panel, which is forward-looking without implementing Phase 4 functionality — good practice.

Build compiles successfully with TypeScript type checking passing.

VERDICT: APPROVE
SUMMARY: Phase 3 delivers a complete, well-structured CRUD UI with filtering, validation, delete confirmation, empty states, and responsive layout — all plan deliverables met.
CONFIDENCE: HIGH
