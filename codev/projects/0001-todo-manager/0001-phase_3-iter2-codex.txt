Phase 3 implementation is aligned with the plan and previous disputed items are now addressed.

- `src/app/page.tsx:15` implements the required responsive layout (`lg:flex-row`) with desktop sidebar + mobile stacked sections.
- CRUD UI is complete for this phase:
  - Create with validation via `src/components/TodoForm.tsx:34`
  - Inline edit flow via `src/components/TodoItem.tsx:52`
  - Delete confirmation via `src/components/TodoItem.tsx:142`
  - Status toggle via `src/components/TodoItem.tsx:26`
  - Status/priority filters via `src/components/FilterBar.tsx:20` and `src/components/FilterBar.tsx:43`
  - Empty state behavior via `src/components/EmptyState.tsx:3` and `src/components/TodoList.tsx:20`
- Plan-aligned testing: Phase 3 specifies manual testing only; no automated UI test requirement is stated in `codev/plans/0001-todo-manager.md` (Phase 3 Test Plan). Existing automated tests (39) remain green (`npm test` passed).

Note: `npm run build` could not be fully validated in this sandbox due a Turbopack OS permission error (process/port binding), which appears environmental rather than a Phase 3 functional defect.
