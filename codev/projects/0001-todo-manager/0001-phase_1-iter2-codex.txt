No blocking findings for `phase_1`.

- Spec/plan scope check: phase-1 scaffold deliverables are present (`package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `next.config.ts`, `vitest.config.ts`, `.env.example`, `.gitignore`, `src/app/layout.tsx`, `src/app/page.tsx`, `src/app/globals.css`).
- Tailwind is correctly configured for v4 via `@import "tailwindcss"` in `src/app/globals.css:1` and PostCSS plugin in `postcss.config.mjs` (so missing `tailwind.config.ts` is not a defect for this version).
- Vitest is configured and runnable (`vitest.config.ts:1`, `src/__tests__/setup.test.ts:1`), and `npm test` passes.
- Lint now passes (`npm run lint` succeeds).
- Railway-ready standalone output is set (`next.config.ts:4`).

Residual risk:
- `npm run build` could not be fully validated in this sandbox due environment restrictions (Turbopack process/port permission error), not a source-level defect.

VERDICT: APPROVE
SUMMARY: Phase 1 implementation is complete and aligned, with Tailwind v4 configuration valid and lint/tests passing.
CONFIDENCE: HIGH
