PR review for [Spec 0001] Todo Manager.

The implementation is comprehensive and well-structured across all 5 phases. 99 tests pass, build succeeds, lint is clean.

Code quality is strong: type-safe action executor with discriminated unions, dependency-injected callbacks for testability, dual payload validation, lazy API key loading, and proper error differentiation.

All spec success criteria are met: CRUD operations, filtering, NL chat interface with 6 action types, date-aware queries, responsive layout, localStorage persistence, Railway deployment configuration.

Test coverage is thorough: 43 storage tests, 43 action executor tests, 12 API integration tests with mocked Gemini.

Minor observations (non-blocking): setup.test.ts canary test is redundant, no E2E tests (acceptable for v1), no localStorage schema versioning (explicitly out of scope).
