I'll start by reading the spec and plan files, then explore the implementation.Now let me explore the project structure to find the implementation:

Now let me verify the key acceptance criteria by checking if the build and tests actually work:Both pass. Let me also quickly read the key source files myself to verify the details:Let me also verify Tailwind is rendering correctly by checking if the dev server actually applies Tailwind classes:I now have a comprehensive picture of the implementation. Let me compile my review.

## Phase 1 Review: Project Scaffolding & Configuration

### 1. Spec Adherence

Checking against Phase 1's deliverables:

| Deliverable | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Next.js project initialized with App Router | ✅ | Next.js 16.1.6 with App Router (`src/app/`) |
| TypeScript configured | ✅ | `tsconfig.json` with strict mode, path aliases |
| Tailwind CSS configured | ✅ | Tailwind v4 via `@tailwindcss/postcss` + `postcss.config.mjs` — no `tailwind.config.ts` needed (correct for v4) |
| Vitest configured with test runner ready | ✅ | `vitest.config.ts` with jsdom, react plugin, path aliases |
| `.env.example` with GEMINI_API_KEY | ✅ | Present with clear comment |
| `.gitignore` updated | ✅ | Comprehensive, includes `.env`, `node_modules`, `.next`, coverage, etc. |
| Basic app layout with responsive shell | ✅ | `layout.tsx` with full-height body, `page.tsx` with max-width container |

### 2. Acceptance Criteria Verification

| Criterion | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `npm run dev` starts without errors | ✅ | (Build succeeds, implying dev works) |
| `npm run build` succeeds | ✅ | Verified — clean build, no errors |
| `npm test` runs | ✅ | Verified — 1 test, 1 passed |
| Tailwind classes render correctly | ✅ | Tailwind v4 pipeline is correctly configured (PostCSS plugin + `@import "tailwindcss"` in globals.css); classes are used in layout.tsx and page.tsx |
| `.env.example` documents GEMINI_API_KEY | ✅ | Present |

### 3. Code Quality

**Positives:**
- Clean, minimal scaffolding — no unnecessary boilerplate
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- Path alias `@/*` configured consistently in both `tsconfig.json` and `vitest.config.ts`
- `output: "standalone"` in `next.config.ts` is appropriate for Railway deployment (Docker-friendly)
- Proper Tailwind v4 setup using `@tailwindcss/postcss` instead of the legacy plugin
- Empty directory structure (`components/`, `hooks/`, `lib/`, `types/`) prepared for subsequent phases

**Minor observations:**
- `@eslint/eslintrc` is in `dependencies` rather than `devDependencies`. This is non-functional but slightly unclean. Not a blocker.
- The spec says "Next.js 14+" but the project uses Next.js 16. This is fine — it satisfies "14+".

### 4. Test Coverage

- One smoke test (`setup.test.ts`) confirming Vitest works. This is appropriate for Phase 1 — the plan explicitly says "Manual Testing" for this phase, and the test plan is just "npm run dev loads, npm run build succeeds, npm test runs."

### 5. Plan Alignment

The implementation follows the plan precisely. All files listed in Phase 1's "Implementation Details" are present:
- ✅ `package.json` — dependencies
- ✅ `tsconfig.json` — TypeScript config
- ✅ `tailwind.config.ts` — Not present, but correctly so for Tailwind v4 (configured via PostCSS instead)
- ✅ `next.config.ts` — Next.js config with standalone output
- ✅ `vitest.config.ts` — test runner configuration
- ✅ `.env.example` — environment template
- ✅ `.gitignore` — ignore patterns
- ✅ `src/app/layout.tsx` — root layout
- ✅ `src/app/page.tsx` — main page (placeholder)
- ✅ `src/app/globals.css` — global styles with Tailwind directives

### 6. Potential Issues (Non-blocking)

1. **`@eslint/eslintrc` in dependencies**: Should be in `devDependencies`. Won't cause problems but inflates production install. Very minor.

2. **No font configuration**: The layout doesn't include a custom font (many Next.js scaffolds use `next/font`). This is fine — the spec doesn't require it, and it can be added later if needed.

VERDICT: APPROVE
SUMMARY: Phase 1 scaffolding is complete and correct — all deliverables present, build succeeds, tests run, Tailwind v4 properly configured, Railway-ready standalone output.
CONFIDENCE: HIGH
