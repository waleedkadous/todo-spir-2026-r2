Findings: None.

I reviewed `phase_4` deliverables against `codev/plans/0001-todo-manager.md` and the relevant implementation/tests, including `src/app/api/chat/route.ts`, `src/lib/gemini.ts`, `src/lib/actionExecutor.ts`, `src/hooks/useChat.ts`, `src/components/ChatPanel.tsx`, `src/components/ChatMessage.tsx`, `src/app/page.tsx`, `src/__tests__/actionExecutor.test.ts`, and `src/__tests__/api-chat.test.ts`.

Phase-4 scope appears complete and aligned:
1. API route exists with payload/structure validation and 100KB enforcement (`src/app/api/chat/route.ts`).
2. Gemini integration and system prompt include action schema + date semantics (`src/lib/gemini.ts`).
3. Chat UI and history flow are implemented (`src/components/ChatPanel.tsx`, `src/hooks/useChat.ts`).
4. Action parsing/execution is validated and LIST filtering count uses filtered results (`src/lib/actionExecutor.ts`).
5. Error handling covers 429, config-unavailable messaging, and generic failures.
6. Tests pass locally (`npm test`: 99/99), including action executor and API chat tests.

Residual risk: there are no direct tests for `useChat` hook behavior, so end-to-end chat UX paths are validated mostly by integration/unit layering rather than hook-level tests.
