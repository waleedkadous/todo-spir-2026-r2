1. **High**: Missing explicit validation requirements for model output and request constraints from spec security section.  
Plan mentions schema validation only as a mitigation, but does not include concrete deliverables/tasks for payload size limit (`max 100KB`), request structure validation, or no-logging/privacy controls required by the spec.  
Refs: `codev/specs/0001-todo-manager.md:189`, `codev/specs/0001-todo-manager.md:190`, `codev/plans/0001-todo-manager.md:209`, `codev/plans/0001-todo-manager.md:229`

2. **High**: Testing scope is incomplete vs spec success criteria.  
Spec requires unit tests for both CRUD logic and **NL action parsing**, but the plan only commits unit tests for storage and integration tests for API route. No explicit unit test target for action parsing/execution.  
Refs: `codev/specs/0001-todo-manager.md:70`, `codev/plans/0001-todo-manager.md:15`, `codev/plans/0001-todo-manager.md:205`, `codev/plans/0001-todo-manager.md:231`

3. **Medium**: Data model constraints are underspecified in implementation tasks.  
Spec requires title max 200 and description max 2000; the plan’s acceptance criteria only checks field presence, not validation constraints/default behavior enforcement points in UI + executor.  
Refs: `codev/specs/0001-todo-manager.md:35`, `codev/plans/0001-todo-manager.md:146`, `codev/plans/0001-todo-manager.md:195`

4. **Medium**: Date semantics from spec are not captured in plan acceptance/tests.  
Spec defines local timezone and Monday–Sunday interpretation for “this week”, but plan does not require or test this explicitly.  
Refs: `codev/specs/0001-todo-manager.md:92`, `codev/specs/0001-todo-manager.md:172`, `codev/plans/0001-todo-manager.md:193`, `codev/plans/0001-todo-manager.md:205`

5. **Low**: Minor process mismatch with repo instruction on commit message format.  
Plan says commits should be `[Spec 0001][Phase: phase_N]...`, while repo instructions expect `[Spec 0001][Phase: implement] ...` pattern (or equivalent agreed convention).  
Refs: `codev/plans/0001-todo-manager.md:287`, `AGENTS.md` (Git Workflow section)

Overall assessment for requested areas:
- Alignment with spec: Mostly aligned on architecture and core features, but gaps above block full compliance.
- Implementation approach/architecture: Good (API proxy + client localStorage is correct).
- Task breakdown/ordering: Reasonable phase order and dependencies.
- Risks: Identified, but mitigation tasks are not sufficiently operationalized.
- Testing strategy: Good base, but missing explicit NL parser unit tests and spec-level date/validation/security cases.
- Missing considerations: request-size validation, privacy/logging constraints, field length validation, week semantics tests.

VERDICT: REQUEST_CHANGES
SUMMARY: Solid phased architecture, but critical spec-to-plan gaps remain in validation/security deliverables and NL action parsing test coverage.
CONFIDENCE: HIGH
---

KEY_ISSUES: Missing concrete tasks for payload/privacy validation, missing NL action parsing unit tests, and missing explicit enforcement/tests for field constraints and date semantics.
