I'll start by reading the spec and plan files, then explore the implementation.Now let me explore the actual implementation:

Now let me read the key implementation files in parallel:Now let me verify that the build, lint, and tests actually pass:All three commands pass. Let me also verify the `standalone` output was actually generated and check the `next.config.ts` for Railway readiness:Good. Now I have everything I need to provide a thorough review.

## Phase 1 Review: Project Scaffolding & Configuration

### Plan Phase 1 Deliverables Checklist

| Deliverable | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Next.js project initialized with App Router | ✅ | Next.js 16.1.6 with App Router (`src/app/`) |
| TypeScript configured | ✅ | `tsconfig.json` with strict mode, path aliases, bundler resolution |
| Tailwind CSS configured | ✅ | Tailwind v4.1.18 via `@tailwindcss/postcss` + `postcss.config.mjs` + `@import "tailwindcss"` in `globals.css` |
| Vitest configured with test runner ready | ✅ | `vitest.config.ts` with jsdom, React plugin, path alias |
| `.env.example` with GEMINI_API_KEY | ✅ | Present and documents the key |
| `.gitignore` updated | ✅ | Comprehensive ignores for Next.js, env files, coverage, etc. |
| Basic app layout with responsive shell | ✅ | `layout.tsx` with full-viewport styling, `page.tsx` with max-width container |

### Acceptance Criteria Verification

| Criterion | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `npm run dev` starts without errors | ✅ | Build succeeds (implies dev works) |
| `npm run build` succeeds | ✅ | Verified — clean build, static pages generated |
| `npm test` runs | ✅ | 1 test, 1 passed |
| Tailwind classes render correctly | ✅ | Build compiles with Tailwind classes in layout/page |
| `.env.example` documents GEMINI_API_KEY | ✅ | Present |

### Spec Adherence (Phase 1 scope)

Phase 1 is scaffolding — no functional features expected yet. The scaffold correctly establishes:
- **Next.js App Router** architecture (not Pages Router, per spec)
- **TypeScript** throughout
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Railway deployment** readiness via `output: "standalone"` in `next.config.ts`
- Empty directory stubs for `components/`, `hooks/`, `lib/`, `types/` — sensible preparation for Phase 2+

### Code Quality

**`eslint.config.mjs`**: Clean flat config using `typescript-eslint` directly. The builder's fix from iteration 1 (moving away from `@eslint/eslintrc` FlatCompat) is solid. `npm run lint` passes cleanly.

**`vitest.config.ts`**: Well-configured — uses `@vitejs/plugin-react` for JSX transform, `jsdom` environment for DOM testing, path alias matching `tsconfig.json`. The `include` pattern `src/**/*.test.{ts,tsx}` is appropriate.

**`tsconfig.json`**: Standard Next.js config with `strict: true`, `jsx: "react-jsx"` (correct for React 19), path aliases configured. The `jsx` setting is `"react-jsx"` which is fine — Next.js will handle this through its own compilation.

**`next.config.ts`**: Minimal and correct. `output: "standalone"` is the right choice for Railway (produces a self-contained server).

**`layout.tsx`**: Clean root layout with Tailwind utility classes. Good responsive base (`min-h-screen`, `antialiased`).

**`page.tsx`**: Simple placeholder with responsive max-width. Appropriate for scaffolding phase.

**`globals.css`**: Single `@import "tailwindcss"` — correct for Tailwind v4.

### Previous Iteration Concerns

1. **Missing `tailwind.config.ts`** — Correctly disputed by builder. Tailwind v4 uses CSS-first configuration. Verified: `@tailwindcss/postcss` v4.1.18 in devDependencies, `@import "tailwindcss"` in globals.css, build succeeds with Tailwind classes. **No issue.**

2. **Broken linting** — Fixed. The ESLint config was rewritten to use `typescript-eslint` flat config directly, avoiding the FlatCompat compatibility issues. `npm run lint` now passes cleanly. **Resolved.**

### Minor Observations (Non-blocking)

1. **`package.json` has `"main": "index.js"`** — This is a leftover from `npm init` and is irrelevant for a Next.js app. Harmless but slightly untidy.

2. **Test file is a trivial smoke test** — This is appropriate for Phase 1. The plan explicitly says "even if no tests yet" and the test runner just needs to work. The setup test serves as a canary that the Vitest + jsdom environment is functional.

3. **No `@testing-library/jest-dom` setup file** — The `vitest.config.ts` has `setupFiles: []`. The `@testing-library/jest-dom` package is installed as a devDependency but not wired into vitest setup yet. This is fine for Phase 1 since no component tests exist yet, but will need to be configured in Phase 2/3 when component tests are added. Not a blocker.

## Verdict

The Phase 1 scaffolding is complete and correct. All deliverables are present, all acceptance criteria pass (build, lint, test), and the project is properly configured for subsequent phases. The previous iteration's concerns have been addressed — the ESLint config is fixed and the Tailwind v4 configuration is correct for the version in use. The codebase is clean and ready for Phase 2.

VERDICT: APPROVE
SUMMARY: Phase 1 scaffolding is complete — all deliverables present, build/lint/test pass, Tailwind v4 and Railway standalone correctly configured.
CONFIDENCE: HIGH
