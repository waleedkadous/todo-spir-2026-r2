Based on the implementation review for Phase 1, here is the verdict.

---
VERDICT: REQUEST_CHANGES
SUMMARY: Project scaffolds and builds successfully, but linting is broken and needs fixing before proceeding.
CONFIDENCE: HIGH
---

KEY_ISSUES:
- `npm run lint` fails with a `TypeError: Converting circular structure to JSON`. This indicates a misconfiguration in `eslint.config.mjs` or a compatibility issue between Next.js 16 and ESLint 9. A working lint setup is critical for maintaining code quality in future phases.
- `tailwind.config.ts` is missing, despite being explicitly listed in the Phase 1 plan deliverables. While Tailwind v4 supports zero-config via CSS imports, the plan specified a config file. Please either add the file or confirm that the current CSS-based configuration is intentional and sufficient for the project's needs.
