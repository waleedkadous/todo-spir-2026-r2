1. **[High] localStorage write failures are not handled, so phase_2 “localStorage unavailable” behavior is not met.**  
`saveTodos` directly calls `localStorage.setItem(...)` without `try/catch`, so quota/private-mode/storage-disabled errors will throw and break add/update/delete flows (`src/lib/storage.ts:18`, `src/lib/storage.ts:66`, `src/lib/storage.ts:94`, `src/lib/storage.ts:105`).  
Phase 2 test plan explicitly includes the localStorage-unavailable edge case, but implementation currently only guards read path (`getTodos`) and not writes.

2. **[Medium] Missing unit tests for the required storage-unavailable edge case.**  
`storage.test.ts` has strong CRUD/validation/filter/sort coverage, but no test that simulates `localStorage.setItem` or `getItem` throwing due to unavailable storage and verifies graceful handling in mutation paths (`src/__tests__/storage.test.ts:77` onward).

Everything else in `phase_2` is aligned and solid:
- Required types and NL action types are present (`src/types/todo.ts:1`, `src/types/actions.ts:3`).
- CRUD + filtering + sort + validation constraints are implemented (`src/lib/storage.ts:43`, `src/lib/storage.ts:70`, `src/lib/storage.ts:98`, `src/lib/storage.ts:108`, `src/lib/storage.ts:123`).
- `useTodos` hook exists and applies filtered/sorted view (`src/hooks/useTodos.ts:14`, `src/hooks/useTodos.ts:48`).
- Tests currently pass: 36/36 (`npm test -- --run`).

VERDICT: REQUEST_CHANGES
SUMMARY: Phase 2 is mostly complete, but write-path localStorage failure handling (and tests for it) is missing against phase requirements.
CONFIDENCE: HIGH

KEY_ISSUES: Unhandled localStorage write errors in `saveTodos`/mutation flows; missing unit tests for localStorage-unavailable edge case.
