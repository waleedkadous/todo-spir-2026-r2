KEY_ISSUES:
- None

### Considerations (Non-Blocking)
- **State Integration**: In Phase 4, ensure `actionExecutor` is designed to interact correctly with the React state from `useTodos`. Since `useTodos` manages the single source of truth (and likely `localStorage` sync), the executor will need to accept the CRUD functions (add, update, delete) as arguments to perform the actions returned by the API.
- **Icon Library**: Phase 3 (UI) doesn't explicitly mention an icon library (e.g., `lucide-react`, `heroicons`). Adding one to `package.json` in Phase 1 or 3 would facilitate building the UI components (edit/delete buttons, status indicators).
- **ID Generation**: Ensure `crypto.randomUUID()` is used for ID generation in `src/lib/storage.ts` as per the spec notes, or add a polyfill if supporting older environments (though standard Next.js 14+ targets usually support it).
