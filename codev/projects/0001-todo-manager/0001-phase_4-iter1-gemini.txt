## Context Files
- Spec: /private/tmp/todo-spir-2026-r2/codev/specs/0001-todo-manager.md
- Plan: /private/tmp/todo-spir-2026-r2/codev/plans/0001-todo-manager.md

## REVIEW SCOPE — CURRENT PLAN PHASE ONLY
You are reviewing **plan phase "phase_4" ONLY**.
Read the plan, find the section for "phase_4", and scope your review to ONLY the work described in that phase.

**DO NOT** request changes for work that belongs to other plan phases.
**DO NOT** flag missing functionality that is scheduled for a later phase.
**DO** verify that this phase's deliverables are complete and correct.

## Instructions

Read the spec and plan files above, then explore the filesystem to find and review the implementation changes.

Please review:
1. **Spec Adherence**: Does the code fulfill the spec requirements for this phase?
2. **Code Quality**: Is the code readable, maintainable, and bug-free?
3. **Test Coverage**: Are there adequate tests for the changes in this phase?
4. **Error Handling**: Are edge cases and errors handled properly?
5. **Plan Alignment**: Does the implementation follow the plan for phase "phase_4"?

VERDICT: REQUEST_CHANGES
SUMMARY: Date filtering logic is missing from the execution layer, preventing date-aware queries from working as specified.
CONFIDENCE: HIGH
---
KEY_ISSUES:
- `src/lib/actionExecutor.ts`: `executeAction` ignores `dueBefore` and `dueAfter` fields from `LIST_TODOS` action when calling `setFilters`, causing date queries (e.g., "due this week") to return all todos.
- `src/types/todo.ts`: `TodoFilters` interface is missing `dueBefore` and `dueAfter` optional properties.
- `src/lib/storage.ts`: `filterTodos` function only filters by status and priority; date range logic is unimplemented.
