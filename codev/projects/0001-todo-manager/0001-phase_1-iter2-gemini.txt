The implementation for Phase 1 is complete and correct.

The builder has successfully addressed previous concerns:
1.  **Tailwind CSS v4**: Verified correct usage of `@tailwindcss/postcss` and `@import "tailwindcss";`. The absence of `tailwind.config.ts` is intentional and correct for v4.
2.  **Linting**: Verified `npm run lint` passes. The configuration uses `typescript-eslint` flat config, resolving the circular dependency issue. While `eslint-config-next` is missing (likely due to ESLint 9 compatibility friction), the base linting works, which is sufficient for scaffolding.
3.  **Build & Test**: Verified `npm run build` succeeds (Next.js 16.1.6) and `npm test` runs successfully with Vitest.

All deliverables for Phase 1 are present and functional.

VERDICT: APPROVE
SUMMARY: Phase 1 scaffolding complete; build, test, and lint commands all pass; Tailwind v4 correctly configured.
CONFIDENCE: HIGH

KEY_ISSUES:
- None. (Note: ESLint config is minimal and lacks Next.js specific rules, but this is acceptable for Phase 1 given the goal of a clean build/lint baseline.)
