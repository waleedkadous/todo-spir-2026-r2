To the Builder:

This implementation of Phase 2 is solid. The type definitions, storage logic, and React hook are well-structured and align with the specification. The test coverage is comprehensive, validating both the happy paths and edge cases like validation errors.

A few minor notes for upcoming phases:
- The `useTodos` hook allows errors (like validation failures) to bubble up. Ensure the UI components in Phase 3 wrap these calls in `try/catch` blocks to display user-friendly error messages.
- `getTodos` relies on `localStorage` availability. The current `typeof window` check handles SSR correctly, initializing with an empty array.

Proceed to Phase 3.
