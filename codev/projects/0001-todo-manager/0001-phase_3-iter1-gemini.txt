To implementation reviewer:

I have completed the review of Phase 3.

---
VERDICT: APPROVE
SUMMARY: The implementation of Phase 3 is complete and functional, providing a robust CRUD UI with filtering and validation.
CONFIDENCE: HIGH
---
KEY_ISSUES:
- None
- Note: The "desktop sidebar + mobile stack" layout mentioned in the plan is not fully implemented (currently a centered single column). This is acceptable as the sidebar's primary content (Chat Interface) belongs to Phase 4, where the layout structure will naturally need to be established.
